        title: "Adversarial Attacks in Image Classification Models",
        content: "This paper explores the vulnerability of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to adversarial attacks using CIFAR-10 images. It evaluates the performance of adversarial training methods, revealing that while the original ResNet50 model performs best on unaltered data, it struggles with adversarial attacks.\n\nThe findings show an improved robustness of defense mechanisms even with small underfit models and this study overall will inform strategies to better defend DNNs from adversarial attacks.",

        content: "This project creates a highly realistic 3D rendering of a helmet using Three.js. The rendering leverages physically based rendering (PBR) techniques to achieve lifelike materials and lighting effects. The helmet model is enhanced with various textures, including albedo, ambient occlusion, emissive lighting, metal roughness, and normal maps.\n\nUse your mouse to rotate and zoom the camera around the helmet üèéÔ∏èüèÅ",

        content: "Ever wanted to add your cat to Minecraft? Or wanted to sip a cup of coffee and gain movement boost? Or dive into the world of Pandora from the Borderlands series and have your companion CL4P-TP by your side... as a complete set of building blocks?\n\nIf you can get past my horrible building skills - the mod is implemented in Java using the Minecraft Forge modding platform. GitHub repo coming soon!",
